# Problem 2

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>, the expected output would be <code>[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]</code>. If our input was <code>[3, 2, 1]</code>, the expected output would be <code>[2, 3, 6]</code>.
