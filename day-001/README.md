# Day 1

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given <code>[10, 15, 3, 7]</code> and <code>k</code> of <code>17</code>, return true since <code>10 + 7</code> is <code>17</code>.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
